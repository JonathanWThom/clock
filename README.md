# Clock
### By Jonathan Thom

It's a clock! I was going to try to use rails for it, but then I remembered that's what we have JS for.

## What's Next

I'll make use of Rails perhaps, by adding some click options or new pages you can visit.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/JonathanWThom/clock
cd clock
bundle install
rake db:create
rake db:migrate db:test:prepare
rails s
```
* _Then, in any modern browser, navigate to:_
```
localhost:3000
```
